<p>Sean O’Connor is a Computer Science freshman student-athlete at Saint Louis University from Grafton, Wisconsin. He is the second child of four boys. He enjoys reading, coding, and drawing. He is a member of SLU’s Swim and Dive team where he participates in the 200 free, 100 free, and the 100 fly. You can probably find Sean at the Simon Rec., the library, or his favorite restaurant Big Daddy’s on the Landing.
Sean’s artwork is a mixture of hyper-realistic paintings with a touch of abstract. He gets his inspiration from Pollock, Kline, and Newman. Studying these grandmasters and their art has given him an exceptional eye and hand when it comes to drawing. He performs his artwork on his laptop using a stylus instead of a paintbrush. This gives him the opportunity to work on his masterpieces anywhere he goes.
